Note from Sam:

Hi, find attached a subset of the simulated data for MC and DDexp.

For these data of DDexp, the trees are found in tree.list[[2]] (with each tree corresponding to the equal sim number), the sig2 matrix found in sig2.matrices[[2]], and the r term in pars.list[[2]][[2]][[1]]. 

For MC, the trees are found in tree.list[[2]], the sig2 matrix is found in sig2.matrices[[2]] and the S term in pars.list[[2]][[2]].

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sam
